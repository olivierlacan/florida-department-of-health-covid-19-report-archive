# Florida Department of Health COVID-19 report archive

An archival repository of all the reports published to date by the Florida
Department of Health on COVID-19

## Source

The PDF reports stored in the repository were originally published on the
[Florida COVID-19 homepage][2] but the Florida Department of Health does
not maintain an all-time public archive so it can be difficult for journalists
and researchers to find them in order to analyze Florida's COVID-19 response.

## Usage

Since the state reports include the entire case line data listing, the file
has become enormous (100 MB+) over time. This means this repository requires
the Git LFS (large file storage) extension to be installed if you're going to
clone the repository to your local machine and use git clone to download all the
files at once. I would recommend using GitHub's zip download feature but it's
not yet compatible with Git LFS so it won't download any of PDF files for you.

You can [learn about and install Git LFS here][1].
